# digital-forensic-ransomware-mic
 This repository shows how to simulate a simple Python-based “ransomware” attack and how Windows Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC) can block untrusted processes from modifying protected files when the folder’s integrity level is set to High (or Medium). All steps are performed inside a Windows 10 VM for safe, repeatable testing.
